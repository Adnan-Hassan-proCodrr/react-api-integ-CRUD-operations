# React CRUD GET Demo

## Introduction
This repository contains a simple React project where I learned how to use the **GET method** to fetch data from an API. This is part of my learning journey in **CRUD operations** in React.

## What is GET Method?
- GET is an HTTP method used to **retrieve data** from a server.
- In this project, we used GET to fetch **posts** from a public API.
- GET requests **do not change any data** on the server, they only read it.

## How I Used GET in React
1. Created a functional component using `React`.
2. Used `useState` to store API data.
3. Used `useEffect` to call the API when the component loads.
4. Used  `axios` to send a GET request.
5. Rendered the response data in the UI.
